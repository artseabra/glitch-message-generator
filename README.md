# Glitch Message Generator

This project is a simple web app that allows users to input text and receive a glitch-style version of their message, similar to the following example:

V̶̩̙̠͐̓͐ë̴̘̩͔́r̷̤̪͈͆̾s̵̡̨̪̖͛ä̸̢̮͉́͋c̴̢̤͉̦͒ȩ̴̠̩̃̾͜ ̵̢̯͕̐͝. B̷̤̜̖͊ü̶̡̮͎͛t̷̛̠̺̓t̶̡̠͔̹͊̄ȩ̷̦̟̃͗ŗ̵̞̠̈́͊f̶̨̫̼͊l̷̠̩̜͒y̵̖̰͎̾͂c̷̪̤̟͑̽ỏ̶̢̞͉r̷̬̹̞͋ȅ̵̫̖͇

## Background

This project was created by Art Seabra, who has no prior coding experience, with the guidance of ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI. It serves as Art's maiden GitHub and Vercel project, showcasing his ability to learn and create using AI assistance.

## How it works

The Glitch Message Generator uses a simple JavaScript function to create the glitch-style message by combining the original text with Unicode combining characters.

## Deployment

The project is hosted on Replit and has been deployed using GitHub and Vercel for seamless updates and accessibility.
